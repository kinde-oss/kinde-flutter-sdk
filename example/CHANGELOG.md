* IOS
Increased minimum IOS version 11.0 -> 13.0 
Reason: Although iOS 11 is supported, targeting iOS 13 or later is recommended for better performance,
access to newer APIs, and improved user experience. Most apps tend to focus on iOS 13 or higher because
devices running iOS 12 or lower represent a very small percentage of active users.
* Android
Migrated from "Imperative apply of Flutter's Gradle plugins" to "Gradle's declarative plugins {} bloc(
also called the Plugin DSL)". Updated gradle version 7.5 -> 8.0. 
Reason: Support for new Android versions, faster builds, gradle build system improvements, 
access to New Build Features and Tools, better IDE and Plugin Integration.
